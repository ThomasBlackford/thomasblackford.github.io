        <h3><a href="https://lichess.org" target="_blank">Lichess</a></h3>
        <p>Lichess is a free, open-source online chess platform that emphasizes minimalism and accessibility, making it extremely user friendly, even on low end systems</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Clear differentiation between game elements and background. Easy to see board and pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent fonts, buttons, and layout across all pages, predictable user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Boards, menus, and info panels are aligned neatly. Everything feels organized.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements like player info, moves, and chat are grouped logically, improving cohesion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://mail.google.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a></h3>
        <p>Gmailâ€™s interface is functional but can feel overwhelming due to crowded menus, sidebars, and lots of icons. I also find GMAIL to take long to load, even on my 2K$ PC.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Moderate contrast, but the abundance of grey/white panels can make some areas hard to see.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Mixed font sizes and icon styles sometimes break visual consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Some elements are tightly packed, and menus sometimes feel misaligned relative to main content.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Some unrelated elements are visually close, which can confuse users (me).</li>
        </ul>
